How to run my program

Run these commands in sequence in the command line. The version of Java I used was 12.0.1
1.javac Individual.java
2.javac Solver.java
3.javac Main.java
4.java Main

Within Main.java there is a variable called numberOfRuns, currently it is set to 500. If you would like to test just one case change this value to 1
