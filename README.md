How to run my program

Run these commands in sequence in the command line. The version of Java I used was 12.0.1. You must be within the directory inside the Command Line in order to use these commands
1.javac Individual.java
2.javac Population.java
3.javac Solver.java
4.javac Main.java
5.java Main

Within Main.java there is a variable called numberOfRuns, currently it is set to 500. If you would like to test just one case change this value to 1
